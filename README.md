# Choba-parser

Choba (short for CHOice BAsed) is an experimental interactive storytelling engine written in JavaScript. It is intended to be used for choice-based interactive fiction (IF), and more.

This is choba-parser, which takes input from a game designer or writer, and turns it into the data structures choba-engine expects.
